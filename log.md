# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Jan 3rd, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Equation Solver, able to do mult/div first then add/subt, simplifiend the equation a bit

**Thoughts:** Parsing the equation is much harder than I thought. I'll calculate how to move the x around now.

### Day 1: Jan 5th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Messed with html and css properties to make a header on my first site, mainly display, position, and float.

**Thoughts:** I'm still a bit confused with all the position and display settings. I should probably review them before continuing.
