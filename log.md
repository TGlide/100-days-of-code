# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Jan 3rd, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Equation Solver, able to do mult/div first then add/subt, simplifiend the equation a bit

**Thoughts:** Parsing the equation is much harder than I thought. I'll calculate how to move the x around now.

### Day 1: Jan 5th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Messed with html and css properties to make a header on my first site, mainly display, position, and float.

**Thoughts:** I'm still a bit confused with all the position and display settings. I should probably review them before continuing.

### Day 2: Jan 6th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Created a navbar for my site

**Thoughts** I was able to clear a lot of misinformation and doubts I had on positioning, and vertical aligning with top and transform proved to be really useful!

### Day 3: Jan 8th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Implemented small media queries and navbar overflow on site

**Thoughts** Dynamic webpages don't seem so distant now, but they sure seem like a piece of work. Really fun though.

### Day 4: Jan 9th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Added image overlays and grid system using html to the site

**Thoughts** The overlay and grid are simple to implement, but add a real nice touch to the overall design! Really loving it.
