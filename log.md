# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Jan 3rd, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Equation Solver, able to do mult/div first then add/subt, simplifiend the equation a bit

**Thoughts:** Parsing the equation is much harder than I thought. I'll calculate how to move the x around now.

### Day 1: Jan 5th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Messed with html and css properties to make a header on my first site, mainly display, position, and float.

**Thoughts:** I'm still a bit confused with all the position and display settings. I should probably review them before continuing.

### Day 2: Jan 6th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Created a navbar for my site

**Thoughts** I was able to clear a lot of misinformation and doubts I had on positioning, and vertical aligning with top and transform proved to be really useful!

### Day 3: Jan 8th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Implemented small media queries and navbar overflow on site

**Thoughts** Dynamic webpages don't seem so distant now, but they sure seem like a piece of work. Really fun though.

### Day 4: Jan 9th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Added image overlays and grid system using html to the site

**Thoughts** The overlay and grid are simple to implement, but add a real nice touch to the overall design! Really loving it.

### Day 5: Jan 11th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Started working on image header

### Day 6: Jan 12, 2018

**Today's Progress:** More design implementations

**Thoughts:** I think I'm focusing too much on design. I'll get back to coding progresses, working on beautifying the site later on.

### Day 7: Jan 14, 2018

### Day 9: Jan 25, 2018

Sorry :c

**Today's Progress:** Changing structure of page, applied bootstrap and finally implemented a good big stock image, that auto-centers meaning it's responsive to everything-a-majing, including my 21:9 desktop.

**Thoughts:** The site is looking preeeetty

### Day 11: Jan 31, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Made a python automation script

**Thoughts:** Python is a really versatile language.

**PS** Gonna take a break from the challenge, since I want to enjoy the holidays. Since next month I'm starting college, I'll take back the challenge there!



## NEW 100 DAYS START
### Since I took a long hiatus I'm taking this challenge back to day 0.

### Day 0: Aug 09, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Started recreating snake using Javascript. Implemented basic movement, growing and eating fruits.

**Thoughts:** The programming logic really changes in the context of making games!

### Day 1: Aug 11, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued snake js. Implemented pausing and dyinggggg

**Thoughts:** Thinking ahead really goes a long way in building code. It can avoid a lot of hassle and rewriting. I think I'm going to do a more planned approach for future projects!

### Day 2: Aug 12, 2018

**Today's Progress:** More snake js! Fixed wonky controls and being able to go back, which also caused sudden death.

**Thoughts:** Implementing controls in games can be a much more complicated process than imagined. In order to provide a seamless experience, the programmer needs to do soemthing more than simply listening to the input. I also understood why some games implement buffering in their games, and I'm thinking of maybe implementing it, albeit with some restrictions.

### Day 3: Aug 13, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Tried learning some Django!

**Thoughts:** This framework has so many features. It seems amazing.

### Day 4: Aug 14, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Messed around with some more Django.

**Thoughts:** Making small progress, gonna try to progress more next time.


### Day 5: Aug 17, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Did some exercises using C at college and after-hours.

**Thoughts:** C is complicated as all hell.

### Day 6: Aug 19, 2018

**Today's Progress:** More Django! I've decided to try and use my controller and create into a page... It worked! I managed to make a submit form to execute a python function, that lets me use volume up and down on my PC, and others, remotely (from the same wifi)!

**Thoughts:** Python is bliss as all heaven.

### Day 6: Aug 20, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Made a script to help me at a game called Word Connect. Basically I generate all possible combinations given the letters, and compare it to the dictionary to see if it's a valid word. Pretty fun and simple!

**Thoughts:** Python is bliss as all heaven. Really.
